# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-analysis
Donald Trump's twitter comments' sentiment analysis using NLP.
Basically It's a Mini Project based on tweets of famous EX President Donald Trump. In this Project, we are just categorizing the tweets based on their sentiments whether they are good or bad.So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, we provide a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. The dataset is provided in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
